### New docs

* A new doc on our [NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/nvml-integration) describes how to use the infrastructure agent and NRI-Flex to monitor GPU usage and performance metrics.
* When Vulnerability Management is working too well, a recent update gives you the power to [ignore vulnerabilities](/docs/vulnerability-management/change-vulnerability-status) you're not concerned about.



### Major changes

* Continued to rewrite the on-host integration docs to make it easier to install and ensure the docs are accurate and up to date. Up this week: [Port](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/port-monitoring-integration) and [Unix](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/unix-monitoring-integration) monitoring integrations.
* Clarified how to manage and use [data retention rules](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention) for single- and multiple-account organizations.
* We've moved version tracking info from [error tracking](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox) to [version tracking](/docs/errors-inbox/version-tracking) and made some quality-of-life improvements along the way.



### Minor changes

* In our [NerdGraph workflows tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-workflows/#update-workflow), added a GraphQL example to add a workflow name and two channels. 
* Added a note that when you're [creating a custom log parsing rule](/docs/logs/ui-data/parsing/#custom-parsing) you need to paste unformatted logs into the parsing UI. 
* Added **View session replays** to the browser [user permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#browser) list.
* Fixed incorrect [Sonarqube config](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/sonarqube-monitoring-integration) file example.
* Added attributes to our data dictionary for the `LlmChatCompletionMessage`, `LlmChatCompletionSummary`, and `LlmEmbedding` event types.
* Added session replay capitalization guidance to our [style guide](/docs/style-guide/capitalization/product-capability-feature-usage).
* Added a stronger definition of [log parsing](/docs/logs/ui-data/parsing) to our intro paragraph.
* Added `gov-aws-api.newrelic.com` to our list of [FedRAMP-compliant endpoints](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/fedramp-compliant-endpoints). 
* Added a NerdGraph mutation example showing how to [rotate an Azure client secret token](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-cloud-integrations-api-tutorial/#rotate-azure-token).
